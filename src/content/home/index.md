I started learning JavaScript when I couldn't understand how pointers worked in C++. At the time, I was only concerned with getting a
program up and running quickly to test something I was working on with one of my teachers back when I was a college freshman. My journey through the world of programming has been quite entertaining ever
since then.

From maxing out the call stack with infinite recursion, to reading the properties of null. From building fullstack apps with MERN, Next js and headless CMS(s) to my computer heating up from solving the classical computer vision and artificial intelligence mnist problem. From using vanilla css for half of my projects (convincing myself that I'll understand css more deeply next time) to surrendering to the almighty power of SASS and open source css frameworks like bulma, bootstrap,and low-level frameworks like tailwind. I can say that I have come a long way.

Now don't get me wrong. I am by no means an expert on web development. I am just a lonely college student who found solace and joy in programming. That does not make me an expert but it helped me understand major concepts in web dev that I didn't know I was ever going to be interested in.

**So, why did I make the c-Archive anyways?** Because I want to share my knowledge with people who either don't believe that they can learn programming or are absolute beginners who have no idea where to start. I am basically the first drill sergeant you meet in the army. Welcome to the field soldier. Think of me as the first or even second stage boss fight of a game. Hopefully, by the time you clear this stage you will have strong fundamentals in JavaScript web development.
